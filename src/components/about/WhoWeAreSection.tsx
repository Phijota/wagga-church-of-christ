        "With more than 20 years of full time ministry experience, my wife Lyn and I are just as keen to serve the Lord among his people as ever!
      </p>
      <p>
        We love Wagga and this church. We have 6 adult Children, with some living here. I have a deep commitment to the Word of God, to discipleship and to the family nature of church which means we must stay relevant to all ages.
      </p>
      <p>
        I came to Christ quite young and have stayed passionate about the development of young Christians, so I am delighted to work among such a talented variety of Christian leaders such as those in our Youth and Music teams.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ultimately, Jesus is the true leader of the church and each Christian must walk with Him at the centre of their life, and Ministry is therefore about humbly keeping in step with Jesus 'the Author and Perfecter of our faith' (Hebrews 12:2)."

      </h3>
      <p><i>Elder</i></p>

      <p>"Years ago, en route to India to find a guru (teacher) to help me discover what life is all about, I was arrested out of rank heathenism by Jesus Christ, in Darwin. Since that time my heart and life has been increasingly narrowed, and expanded, to an all-encompassing preoccupation with knowing the true and living God in Jesus Christ, and with seeking to see others come to the same life-transforming encounter, and grow to maturity in this reality."</p>

        "My wife June and I both came to know Christ in 1972. Since then we  have shared a desire to serve the Lord - no matter where or how! Our time serving with the Institute of Evangelism in Papua New Guinea enabled us to grow and understand other cultures, which has been a blessing in our serving of the Lord and His people."
