      <p>"Years ago, en route to India to find a guru (teacher) to help me discover what life is all about, I was arrested out of rank heathenism by Jesus Christ, in Darwin. Since that time my heart and life has been increasingly narrowed, and expanded, to an all-encompassing preoccupation with knowing the true and living God in Jesus Christ, and with seeking to see others come to the same life-transforming encounter, and grow to maturity in this reality."</p>

        "My wife June and I both came to know Christ in 1972. Since then we  have shared a desire to serve the Lord - no matter where or how! Our time serving with the Institute of Evangelism in Papua New Guinea enabled us to grow and understand other cultures, which has been a blessing in our serving of the Lord and His people."
