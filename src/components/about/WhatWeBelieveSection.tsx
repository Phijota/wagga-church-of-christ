      <h2>Our Confession of Faith</h2>
      <h4>Jesus</h4>
      <p>
        Jesus of Nazareth was the incarnation of the eternal Son of God. While
        on earth He was also wholly man, and now continues to be, in heaven, wholly
        man and wholly God.
        Through His incarnation, His life of flawless obedience to His Father in
        heaven, death on the cross, burial, resurrection, ascension, and exaltation to
        glory, all according to the will of God, He gave His life a ransom for many.
        He now shares the glory with His Father that He shared before the
        world was, and will return to earth to judge the world in righteousness and
        receive to Himself His Bride, the Church.
      </p>

      <h4>The Church</h4>
      <p>
        All who become indwelt by God by the Holy Spirit baptism through
        repentance and faith in Jesus Christ, belong to the Church. This includes all
        from the beginning of creation who had believing response to the Holy Spirit&#39;s
        illumination of truth, while yet not living during the present era before which
        the Holy Spirit baptism was not available as it is since Christ&#39;s exaltation to
        the right hand of God.
        The Church is the fulness of Christ, and throughout the eternal ages to
        come will be the vessel through which the glory of God will be ceaselessly
        expressed.
      </p>

      <h4>Redemption</h4>
      <p>
        Man is fatally flawed in consequence of the Fall in Eden. In rebellion
        against God he is hopelessly and helplessly lost. By the pure grace of God,
        through faith in Christ alone, he is given the opportunity to be delivered from
        this terminal condition by the power of God. Thus delivered man is united with
        God in Christ in the Spirit and very Life of God. Christ in man becomes His
        life, His salvation and His redemption from sin and death. In this redemption,
        man is made fit to enjoy eternal fellowship with God and his fellow believers
        throughout the eternal ages to come.
      </p>


      <h4>The Bible</h4>
      <p>
        The Bible, although penned by many men, over the period of many
        centuries, is the Holy Spirit-inspired Word of God. As such it is God&#39;s Self-
        revelation, and can be thought of as “Jesus in print.” All true interpretation of
        the scriptures only comes by revelation of the Holy Spirit, and is, in fact,
        revelation, in measure, of the eternal Son of God Himself.
      </p>

      <h4>Baptism</h4>
      <p>
        There is one baptism, which is the baptism in the Holy Spirit, and which
        is bestowed by Jesus Himself upon all who through repentance and faith in
        Him yield themselves to His Lordship. Baptism in water is the believer&#39;s
        testimony, in deed, to others of having been thus baptised by Christ in the
        Holy Spirit.
