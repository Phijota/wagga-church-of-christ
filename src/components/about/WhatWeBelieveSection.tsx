      <h2>What we believe</h2>
      <h4>Jesus</h4>
      <p>
        We believe that Jesus is the risen Son of God and the Saviour of
        humanity.
      </p>
      <p>
        We believe that Jesus died on a cross as a sacrifice for the world's
        sin, and that he rose again,
        to eternal life and now sits at the right hand of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        We encourage people to discover who Jesus is, through reading the
        Bible, and to pray and earnestly seek him.
      </p>
      <p>
        We encourage people to respond to Jesus by making an intelligent and
        meaningful commitment to him, and to observe his teaching.
      </p>

      <h4>The Bible</h4>
      <p>
        We affirm the Scriptures in the Bible as the word of God, and our
        authority for Christian belief and practice.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Bible declares that all who accept Jesus as Saviour and Lord
        are Christians, and so we cooperate with other Christians in worship,
        witness and service. We promote the unity of all God's people, and we
        are committed to the ultimate goal of unity among all Christians.
